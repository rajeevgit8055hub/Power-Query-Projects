Data Cleaning with Power Query

Data Cleaning and Transformation using Power Query...

Skills: Microsoft Advance Excel | Power Query

This project involved cleaning and organizing a raw, unstructured dataset with multiple issues such as duplicate columns, inconsistent casing (uppercase, lowercase, mixed), merged columns, and numerous null or blank values.

Key steps performed:

1. Converted raw data into a structured table and loaded it into Power Query Editor.
2. Applied "Capitalize Each Word" to standardize text case.
3. Split merged columns using the "Split Column" feature and removed unnecessary blank columns.
4. Merged fragmented city columns after splitting (e.g., “New York” split into two columns).
5. Filled missing values with placeholders such as “N/A” where required.
6. Utilized the "Columns from Examples" feature to extract and organize complex data without manual splitting.
7. Reordered columns in a logical sequence for better readability.
8. Used the “Detect Data Type” feature to assign appropriate data types (text, number, date) to each column.
9. Converted specific columns like Working ID and Email to lowercase for consistency.
10. Finally, loaded the cleaned and transformed data back to Excel for further analysis.

This project enhanced my skills in Power Query, data cleaning, and transformation, preparing data for reliable and accurate analysis.
